            <h3>What is this site?</h3>
                <p>The Archivist has taken the liberty of providing a digital record of their favorite stories—and eventually every story—the Archive has to tell. Each of these stories are ever growing and changing as they evolve in real time. As such, expect changes to the greater lore as deeper understandings are reached about the worlds and more perspectives are achieved and reviewed. You will read everything from the mundane lives of interdimentional baristas to the action packed warzones of the Equestrian Wastes. Consider this a cover-all disclaimer that each story could and likely will contain something(s) that may be triggering to some audiences. Proceed with caution and curiosity.</p>
                <p>For the better understanding in your reality, view this site as the collection of stories written and created by CosmicArchivist. Both as a portfolio for a showing of works, a collection to be viewed and enjoyed by the public, and as a personal way of keeping tabs on the greater lore in a more organized way. Enjoy these tales and may they inspire you to delve into worlds of your own.</p>
